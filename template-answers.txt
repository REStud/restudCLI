  - &save_output Save all the output of the analysis in some standard format into the replication package. Tables can be saved as .csv, .xls or .tex files. It is also sufficient to save the Stata .log file. In this case, please report in the README the line numbers where the readers can find the table numbers. Figures can be saved in .eps, .pdf or .png.
  - &stata_packages Add all Stata packages to the README that you use with instructions on how to install them.
  - &relative_path Replace absolute paths in the scripts with relative paths. Let readers know which folder to run your code from and use paths relative to that.
  - &cite_data Add data citations in the README as well as the manuscript for each dataset you use, whether you include it in the package or not. Citing data sources in the manuscript is the best was of directing readers to them. Please see here (https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/) for examples and further guidance.
  - &DAS Include formal Data Availability Statements for each of the datasets you are using. The goal is to describe clearly the steps that readers have to take if they want to access the data. Please see here (https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/) for examples and further guidance.
  - &include_data If the license permits, include raw data in the replication package. URLs to data websites may change and future readers may not be able to easily find the datasets you use.
  - &confidential_data I understand some of your data is confidential. To help me understand the context better, please answer the following questions in an email to me (not in the README). https://restud.github.io/data-editor/before/#what-if-your-dataset-is-confidential
