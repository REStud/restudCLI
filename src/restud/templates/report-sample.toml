# Sample TOML Report Format
# This replaces the YAML report format with TOML for better readability
# and support for colons and special characters without escaping

# TAG USAGE:
# You can reference reusable text snippets from base-snippets.toml by name
# For example, in comments or text fields, use the tag name with * prefix (e.g., "*DAS", "*cite_data", "*macosx")
# and it will be automatically replaced with the full snippet text
# See base-snippets.toml for all available tags
