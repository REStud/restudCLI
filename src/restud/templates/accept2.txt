Data editor report, ReStud MS {manuscript_id}

Dear {salutation},

Thank you for making the changes I asked for. I have now accepted the package.

{praise}

If you have not done it yet, please edit the Zenodo entry and add it to the Restud list by selecting 'restud-replication' among Communities. (This will not change the DOI.)

Add the Zenodo DOI to the Data Availability Statement (DAS) at the end of the manuscript you are sending to Ann (in cc). The DAS is something like "The data and code underlying this research is available on Zenodo at https://dx.doi.org/[doi].", but please see other examples here: https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/authors/preparing_your_manuscript/research-data-policy#data2
Best regards,

Andrea
